# The Site
We opted to use Django as our webframework. As our model was made in python, integration was easy. Read WebWorldWindDocs.ipynb for details.

## Files to look out for

The most important files in this directory are:
1.) views.py, this file controls backend integration of our model with the site
2.) app.html. This file is where the magic happens. Most of our WebWorldWind code is in here.
3.) The /static/js folder. The WebWorldWind code for our site is in here. We have also made minor alterations to LayerManager.js 
so that we have a search bar that meets our needs.
